Here this is Student Proctor Management system where the system stores the details of the student related to their academics as well as their Extra co-curricular activities. A protor is assigned to each group of students to keep a check on students academics and his/her overall performance as a student. The performance monitoring will thus help the Proctors to guide students towards their main goal.
